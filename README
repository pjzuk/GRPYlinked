***************************
    USAGE:
***************************


The GRPYlinked is a standalone program and should install on any computer with fortran compiler.
For the Unix system with make build system it is sufficient to enter
  GRPYlinked
folder and type
  make
This should produce executable file
  GRPYlinked.exe
inside 
  bin
folder.

To uninstal it is sufficient to run
  make clean
inside the GRPYlinked folder

The examples of usage are given in 
  results
folder. We also provide a scripts
  runPrograms
in each folder which contain all necessary commands to simulate the trajectory and run the python script for calculating the Mean Square Discplacement from the trajectory.

In the folder where program will be executed user has to provide 
  control_file.dat
file including the necessary simulation parameters. They are specified entry by entry in the examples.
User also has to specify
  model.dat
file which contains sphere radii and linker lengths. The order of entries is also explained in the examples.


***************************
        UNITS:
***************************


calculating the mobility matrices we assume that
\pi \eta = 1
thus the translational mobility coefficient for a single sphere will return
1 / (6 \pi \eta a) = 1 / (6 a)
where a is particle radius.

The energy unit is
k_B T
Such choice specifies the relation between length scale and time scale:
a single sphere with radius 0.5 will have a means sqaure displacement
MSD(t) = 2 t.


***************************
        REMARKS:
***************************


GRPYlinked has a simple Euler time integration mechanism, which can lead to unphysically large displacements if time step is too large as interaction potentials are steep.

Please read the source code for more details.
